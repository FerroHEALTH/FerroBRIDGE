# Provenance: the HL7 Europe Imaging Report R4 guide hl7.fhir.eu.imaging

Vendored by `scripts/vendor/eehrxf.sh`, each artefact pinned by its
URL and the sha256 of its bytes. Never edit a file here: change the pins in
the script and the pin-set digest in docs/VERSIONS.md, and re-run the script.

- Pin-set digest (sha256 over the sorted `mode  file  url  sha256` lines of
  the pins): `aad98731a1f2597d6a7defa2c7f6ab7297781b677398383346c5592f913c9f4b`
- Fetched: 2026-10-28, with the User-Agent `ferrobridge-vendor (scripts/vendor)`
- Artefacts: 1 committed, 0 cache only, 0 needing
  manual retrieval
- Files in this directory: 1 besides this one, each verbatim as the
  publisher serves it
- Tree digest (sha256 over the sorted per-file `sha256  path` listing,
  `PROVENANCE.md` excluded): `5908ab6216a4931783642948841ad9830a38eefd2a0d466f7384b0e1746cf8e8`
- Read by: #1314 (the eehrxf tests, crates/eehrxf/tests/it/, which read
  the exchange-format proxies the component is designed against)
