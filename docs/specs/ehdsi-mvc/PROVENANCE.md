# Provenance: the MyHealth@EU Master Value Sets Catalogue myhealth.eu.fhir.mvc-package

Vendored by `scripts/vendor/eehrxf.sh`, each artefact pinned by its
URL and the sha256 of its bytes. Never edit a file here: change the pins in
the script and the pin-set digest in docs/VERSIONS.md, and re-run the script.

- Pin-set digest (sha256 over the sorted `mode  file  url  sha256` lines of
  the pins): `06f68a58f7382db396f029b1c0a420fcac6cbf53d8a948df47594937b0886749`
- Fetched: 2026-10-28, with the User-Agent `ferrobridge-vendor (scripts/vendor)`
- Artefacts: 1 committed, 0 cache only, 0 needing
  manual retrieval
- Files in this directory: 1 besides this one, each verbatim as the
  publisher serves it
- Tree digest (sha256 over the sorted per-file `sha256  path` listing,
  `PROVENANCE.md` excluded): `d9a0fdf35558948ae75f47d4d621443540cae825ec4d3cf499193c0f3e124cbf`
- Read by: #1314 (the eehrxf tests, crates/eehrxf/tests/it/, which read
  the exchange-format proxies the component is designed against)
