# Provenance: hl7.terminology.r4 7.2.0

Fetched verbatim at build time by `scripts/vendor/profile-packages.sh` into
`package/` beside this file, which `.gitignore` refuses, as a run-time input
of the R4 profile validator (.claude/rules/vendored-inputs.md). Never commit a
file from there and never edit one: change the pin in docs/VERSIONS.md, run the
script with `--stamp`, and record the count and digest it prints.

- Stamped: 2026-11-06

Each declared dependency is fetched beside this tree at the version named,
except `hl7.fhir.r4.core` 4.0.1, which is read from the committed
`tools/fhir-codegen/vendor/hl7.fhir.r4.core/`, and except the
dependencies of a package of another FHIR release, which the R4 set holds
and never reads. The two lines above let `--check` assert the closure from
the committed files alone.

## Why build time

The package set unpacks to about 650 MB, seven versions of
`hl7.terminology.r4` and `hl7.fhir.uv.xver-r5.r4` among it, for input only
the validator and its tests read. The licences would permit vendoring; the
size decides. CI restores the trees from a cache keyed on
`scripts/vendor/profile-packages.sh --cache-key`, and the script verifies the
count and digest of a restored tree as it does of a download.
