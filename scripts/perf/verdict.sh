# The verdict of the performance gate (#1656, #1737), run by the perf
# workflow's verdict job over the three attempt jobs.
#
#   scripts/perf/verdict.sh
#       Reads RESULT_1 to RESULT_3, each attempt job's result (success,
#       failure, cancelled, skipped or empty), CODE_1 to CODE_3, each
#       attempt's gate exit code, and RUN_CANCELLED, "true" when the run
#       itself was cancelled. Passes when the last attempt that ran ended
#       with exit 0. An attempt job that failed fails the gate. A cancelled
#       attempt that a later attempt followed lost its runner while the run
#       went on, and was retried; the last attempt cancelled fails the gate.
#       Names every attempt in $GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY when it is set.
#   scripts/perf/verdict.sh --self-test
#       Proves the verdict over every shape of the three attempts, offline.
#
# No specification governs this: our own design.
