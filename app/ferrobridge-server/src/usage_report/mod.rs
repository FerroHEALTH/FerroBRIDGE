//! The `FerroHEALTH` installation report to `FerroPULSE`.
//!
//! One `start` report at each `serve` start and one `daily` report a day,
//! carrying the installation id, the version, the licence grant type, the
//! deployment kind, coarse host size, the enabled lanes, the mapping counts
//! as ranges, the upstream health, and latency aggregates per route group.
//! The wire contract is `FerroPULSE`'s report envelope v2
//! (`docs/report-v2.md`), and every report the server builds is validated
//! against its vendored schema in the tests. A report carries no clinical
//! content, no identifier other than the instance id, no mapping name, no URL
//! and no request path: the payload types have no member that could hold
//! one, and [`window`] classifies a request by its matched route template
//! alone. It is on by default; `[usage_report] enabled = false` stops it, a
//! CI environment stops it, and so does the lack of a writable state
//! directory. One boot line says which ([`reporter::announce`]). No
//! specification governs any of this: our own design.
//!
//! - [`config`]: the section, resolved, and the CI detection.
//! - [`payload`]: the typed report.
//! - [`window`]: the in-process metrics window and its rendering.
//! - [`state`]: the instance id and the last start time on disk.
//! - [`reporter`]: assembly, sending, scheduling.
