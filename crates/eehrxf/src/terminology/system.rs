//! The FHIR `Coding.system` an openEHR terminology id is written as
//! (feature `openehr`).
//!
//! FHIR R4 `Coding.system` is a `uri`, "the identification of the code
//! system that defines the meaning of the symbol in the code"
//! (<https://docs.rs/fhir-types/0.1.108/fhir_types/r4/coding/struct.Coding.html>).
//! openEHR names a terminology by a short identifier, "typically a value
//! like `"snomed_ct"` that is mapped elsewhere to the full URI identifying
//! the terminology" (openEHR BASE Release 1.1.0, Foundation Types,
//! `TERMINOLOGY_CODE.terminology_id`), taken from the US National Library
//! of Medicine UMLS list (openEHR RM Release 1.1.0, Support IM, Terminology
//! Package, Terminology Identifiers). [`fhir_system`] is that mapping:
//!
//! - `local` is the system of the archetype the code is defined in,
//!   [`archetype_local`];
//! - an identifier of [`OPENEHR_NAMES`] is the URI it names;
//! - an identifier that is itself an absolute URI is its own system;
//! - any other identifier has no known system, and no coding is written
//!   for it.
//!
//! The version part of a terminology id, "Version of this terminology, if
//! versioning supported, else the empty string" (openEHR BASE 1.1.0,
//! `TERMINOLOGY_ID.version_id`), is the FHIR `Coding.version`, "the version
//! of the code system which was used when choosing this code" (FHIR R4
//! `Coding.version`), only in the form the code system's versions take.
//! [`fhir_version`] is that rule.
