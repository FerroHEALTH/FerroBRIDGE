//! The crosswalk of a category's dataset to the eHealth Network guideline and
//! to the HL7 Europe profile of its document.
//!
//! The eHealth Network guideline, the Xt-EHR logical model and the HL7 Europe
//! profile are three views of one dataset. A [`Crosswalk`] keys each row on
//! the Xt-EHR element path and names, beside it, the eHealth Network element
//! ids, the producer obligation the obligations profile puts on the element,
//! the element of the HL7 Europe profile (a slice, where the profile slices)
//! that carries it, and the profiles a FHIRconnect context may map to in
//! order to feed it. The rows are data; [`Crosswalk::check`] holds them to the
//! packages they name, so a re-pinned package that moves an element, a slice
//! or an obligation fails the check.
