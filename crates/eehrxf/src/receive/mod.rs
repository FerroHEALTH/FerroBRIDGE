//! Receiving a document in the exchange format (feature `fhir-r4`).
//!
//! Annex II 2.2 and 2.3 of Regulation (EU) 2025/327 ask an EHR system that
//! stores, intermediates or gives access to personal electronic health data
//! to "be able to receive" them in the European exchange format, by means of
//! this component. A [`ReceivedDocument`] is that receipt: a FHIR R4 document
//! `Bundle`, decoded strictly against the R4 resource definitions, held to
//! the R4 document rules, with its subject resolved to the `Patient` entry
//! and its original text kept byte for byte.
//!
//! - [`category`]: the priority category the document's `Composition.type`
//!   names, and the profiles a document of it is checked against;
//! - [`conform`]: the document checked against the profiles of its category,
//!   read from the vendored package;
//! - [`validation`]: the document held to every constraint of its profiles
//!   and of the profiles its entries claim, by FerroBRIDGE's validator;
//! - `openehr` (feature `openehr`): the document mapped into one openEHR
//!   composition by FHIRconnect, the original kept beside the mapped content.
//!
//! Nothing here reaches a CDR. Which member stores the composition, and how
//! it is reached, is the system's to decide.
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use eehrxf::receive::ReceivedDocument;
//!
//! let text = std::fs::read_to_string("document.json")?;
//! let document = ReceivedDocument::read(&text)?;
//! assert_eq!(document.original(), text);
//! # Ok::<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>>(())
//! ```
